# horiseon-accessibility-refactor

## Description

This project showcases a website that looks good to the user, though the underlying code is not formatted in the best way.
The original code was given to us without semantic HTML tags, and lots of code was refactored to make it more efficient (ie combining multiple elements into one class for more efficent formatting).
This project helped me in the following ways:
-I was able to break down existing code and analyze it.
-The sections with repeating elements helped me understand and conceptualize classes
-I leveraged the inspect element feature to research and compare my code with the original. It was also great experimenting wiht the built in tools to see changes happen in real time.

Dennis Itua, tutor at SMU Boot Camp, assisted with one main portion: I had applied formatting to a header tag. I learned this was not good practice since the header tag can be applied to numerous sections. This was corrected by having me create a class called header instead.
